# BoulderShare

A simple app that lets you pick a photo from a gallery or take a photo with your camera app, mark holds on it and share it with your friends!

# Instructions:
- Add a hold by taping on the photo
- Remove a hold by taping inside of an existing hold
- Change the hold type by long pressing inside of an existing hold (next hold will be of the same type)
- Resize the hold with a pinching gesture inside an existing hold
- Once you're done share the image with your climbing buddies by clicking the Share icon
